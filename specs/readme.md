#Attention
This folder and all the spec stuff, like furo.spec.conf.json and _specbuild,  is intended to be in a different repository.
It is in this project **just for demonstrating** purposes.

Putting the specs in a different repo, give you a lot of advantages. 
- independet API design cycle from the dev. cycle
- multiple clients can consume the api specs
- ...

## Build
run `npm run build:spec` to generate the needed environment files
